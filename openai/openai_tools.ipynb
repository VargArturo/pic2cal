Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the yeast, flour, and salt and stir with a rubber spatula just until all the water is absorbed and a dry, clumpy dough forms. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 minutes, to allow the flour to absorb the water. Use the dough hook of a stand mixer and mix the dough on low speed (2 on a KitchenAid mixer) for 8 to 10 minutes. It will still be a little lumpy, although it will gather into a ball around the hook. Pull it off the dough hook and knead it by hand for a few strokes on an unfloured surface until it is very smooth and springy. (Alternatively, scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead with smooth, steady strokes until silky smooth and springy, 10 to 12 minutes. Avoid kneading extra flour into the dough.) Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled, clear, 2-quart straight-sided container with a lid. With masking tape, mark the spot on the container where the dough will be once it has increased 1 1/2 times in volume. Cover and leave it to rise at room temperature (70 to 75 degrees) for 45 minutes. It will increase by about 25 percent. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and, using a bench scraper or spatula, empty the risen dough out of the container. Pat it gently into a rectangle, about 6 x 8 inches, and fold it into thirds like a business letter. With the short side facing you, lift the top edge and fold it into the center of the rectangle; lift the near edge and fold it into the center so that it overlaps the top edge by about 1-inch. Quickly slide both hands under the dough and flip it over so the folds are underneath. Slip it back into the container, pushing it down to fit. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm and draft-free spot until it expands, reaching halfway to the masking tape mark. 45 minutes to 1 hour. About 1 hour before baking, place a baking stone on the middle rack of the oven and a cast-iron skillet on the lower rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. (If you are baking the breads on a baking sheet, its only necessary to preheat the oven about 20 minutes before baking.) Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Uncover the dough and turn it out onto the work surface. With a bench scraper or chefs knife, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces. Gently pat each piece into a rough rectangle and fold it in half. Sprinkle the pieces of dough with flour and lightly drape them with plastic wrap. Let them relax on the counter for 10 minutes. Cover a bakers peel or rimless baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with flour. Set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, pat the dough into a rough rectangle measuring about 3 x 5 inches. With the longer side facing you, fold the top of the dough down about one-third of the way toward the center. With the heel of your hand, press along the seam using firm but gentle pressure. Fold the bottom of the dough about one-third of the way toward the center and seal the seam firmly. Fold this skinny rectangle in half, bringing the top edge down to meet the bottom edge. Working from right to left, cup your hand over the log of dough arid press the heel of your hand down firmly to seal the seam. Dust the work surface with additional flour to prevent the dough from sticking. To stretch the log, place your hands together, palms down, over the middle of the log. Using light, even pressure, roll the log back and forth as you spread your hands apart. Repeat 3 or 4 times until the log is the desired length, about 14 inches long. Leave the ends rounded. Place the baguettes on the parchment, seam sides down, about 2 inches apart. Lift the parchment between the loaves, making pleats and drawing the loaves together. Tightly roll two kitchen towels and slip them under the parchment paper on the sides of the two outer loaves to support and cradle the baguettes. Lightly dust the tops of the baguettes with flour and gently drape them with plastic wrap. Let the loaves stand at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes. They will increase about 1 1/2 times in size. Uncover the loaves, take away the towels, and stretch the parchment paper out so it is flat and the loaves are separated. Score each baguette with a single-edge razor blade or a serrated knife. Starting from the tip, angle the blade 45 degrees to make 3 slashes about 3 inches long and 1/2-inch deep. Slide the loaves, still on the parchment, onto the hot baking stone or rimless baking sheet. Place 1/2 cup of ice in the hot cast-iron skillet and slide back onto the lower rack to produce steam. Bake the baguettes until caramel colored, 15 to 20 minutes. Slide the peel or baking sheet under the parchment paper to remove the loaves from the oven. Slide the loaves, still on the parchment, onto a wire rack to cool. Eat them warm or at room temperature. Freeze leftover baguettes in resealable plastic bags for up to 1 month.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

Create a well in the middle of the mixture and add one half of the yeast/water mixture. Work the water/yeast mixture in by hand. Dough should be very crumbly, and not really hold together. Add olive oil and the rest of the water/yeast mixture, and continue to combine by hand until dough is soft and smooth. (Alternate, if using fresh oregano and garlic) Add to the above step, add in garlic and oregano, and combine by hand until dough is soft and smooth. Place dough on a flat surface and vigorously knead for about 10 minutes. Alternatively, using an electric mixer with a dough hook, let the mixer work the dough for about 7 minutes under low-medium setting. Put dough in a greased bowl (or a lightly oiled bowl), and make sure grease/oil covers the outside of the dough. Let rise for 45-60 minutes in a warm (80-90 degree) place. Once dough has risen (increased to about double in size), punch it down (about three firm punches to the dough\\'s surface), knead for another 2-3 minutes, and allow to rise again, per the instructions above). Repeat this step for a total of three rises. After the dough has risen for the third time, separate into two pieces (or more, if smaller pizzas are desired). Roll pizzas out into 13-14 inch circles and top as desired. Bake in a 475 degree oven for 20-25 minutes, or until crust is crispy and golden brown. A baking stone is strongly recommended. If using a baking stone, lightly sprinkle with corn meal to prevent sticking. To parbake (half bake the dough, and save for later), follow the above baking directions, but only bake for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours, or freeze so they\\'ll last longer. Alternative baking method - if your oven has the capability to do so, preheat oven and baking stone to 600 degrees. Adjust cooking time to 5-10 minutes, or until crust is crispy and golden brown. This method can also utilize bread flour, as it cooks at a high enough temperature to allow the bread flour to rise properly during cooking, yet not allow the glutens to break down during cooking and cause the dough to collapse, thus making for a soggy pizza. This is my preferred method, as it allows for a reduced cooking time and more of a \"brick oven pizza\" flavor and crispiness. It\\'s also the preferable method to cook pizzas with more liquid ingredients, such as tomato sauce, fresh tomatoes, etc.\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

Add salt, whole wheat and all-purpose flours; process until smooth, about 15 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl. Continue to process until dough just pulls completely away from sides of bowl (adding more flour as necessary) and it is soft and satiny, about 30 seconds. Remove from the bowl and knead once or twice on a lightly floured counter. Place dough in medium bowl, cover with a clean towel, and place in draft-free spot until dough doubles in size about 45 minutes. Preheat a pizza stone or cookie sheet in the bottom third of a 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) oven for at least 30 minutes. Turn dough onto lightly floured work surface. Divide into 8 equal pieces, and roll each piece into a ball on your work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll each ball out to a 4 (10 cm) circle.

I often cook 1/2 batch, then save the remaining dough for a meal in the near future. * Work quickly when getting the bread in and out of the oven. YOURE LOSING HEAT! * To cook on the stove top, preheat a dry cast iron pan over medium high heat for 5-10 minutes. Grill bread on the hot pan until small bubbles appear.

In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or using a hand mixer, mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. (You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.) In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. (You should still see small bits of butter.) Transfer the dough to a work surface and shape into a round, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature to make it more workable. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don\\'t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don\\'t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 12 inches wide for a 10-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie pan nearby. To transfer the crust to the pan, I find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don\\'t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don\\'t be concerned; we\\'ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. To decorate the rim, fold under the excess dough then just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. . Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. If baking with the filling, chill until ready.\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

Grill burgers, flipping occasionally. We prefer ours medium rare, and it usually takes less than 10 minutes total cook time. But the cook time will vary depending on your grill and preference for done-ness. Note: This recipe utilizes a club pack of ground beef because I like to make a bunch at once and freeze them. To freeze, arrange the un-cooked patties in a single layer on a waxed-paper lined cookie sheet and place in the freezer until hard. Then transfer to freezer bags or vacuum-sealed bags. If you try to vacuum seal the raw meat, the patties will not retain their shape.

Let the mix rise for 12 hours or until it looks double in size and very bubbly. Make the cooked pre-dough. Mix the cooked pre-dough ingredients (60 g whole grain spelt, 290 ml water and 13 g salt) in a small pot. Heat on medium low until it thickens up. Make sure you whisk or stir it while it\\'s cooking so there are no clumps. Let cool for a couple hours before mixing the main dough, or do up to 2 days ahead and store in the fridge - just bring to room temp before using. Time to make the main dough! Mix together the bubbly pre-dough, cooked pre-dough and the rest of the ingredients except for the seeds and raisins. Remove to a floured surface and knead until the dough comes together. Fold the raisins into the dough. Note: the dough is probably quite soft so sprinkle flour on your hands and the surface if it\\'s sticking too much. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes. If it\\'s sticking a lot, just continuously stretch a little and fold over itself. After about 10 minutes, it will become smooth and elastic. Fold in the flax and sunflower seeds and knead another minute. Form into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 1 hour or until doubled. Remove the dough from the bowl and onto a floured surface. Form into a oblong or round loaf. Place the loaf, with the crease facing up, into oblong pot or round bowl lined with a well-floured cloth. If you have a banneton/proofing basket, you can use that! Let it rise another 1 hour. After rising it should have increased in size considerably. While rising, preheat the oven to 480F/350C. Place a metal or class oven dish filled with about 1-2 inches (5-10 cm) water on the bottom rack - it will create steam that makes the bread better :) Once the oven is preheated and the pan of water is simmering, remove the dough from the cloth or basket and onto a lined baking sheet with the crease facing down. Quickly cut 2 slits across the top and immediately place in the oven on the center rack (watch out for the steam when opening the oven!) Bake for 8 minutes with the steam at 480F/350C. Then remove the pan of boiling water and lower the oven heat to 400F/200C. Bake for an additional 38-40 minutes. Remove and let cool on a rack for 1-2 hours. Dig in! !\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

To make the filling: Place the filling ingredients into a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Set the mixture aside. To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead everything together, by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle, till you\\'ve made a smooth dough. If you\\'re kneading in a stand mixer, it should take about 7 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. In a bread machine (or by hand), it should form a smooth ball. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other rising container. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, for 1 to 2 hours, or until it\\'s nearly doubled in bulk. Rising may take longer, especially if you\\'ve kneaded by hand. Give it enough time to become quite puffy. Divide the dough into about 64 pieces. Just divide the dough in half, then each half in half again, and so on, until you have about 64 pieces. Don\\'t bother to make the pieces perfectly even; and never mind rolling them into perfect little balls (though it\\'s good to give them a quick roll between your palms). Place the chocolate mixture into a shallow pan, such as an 8\" round cake pan. To make the coating, combine the 2 tablespoons melted butter and 2 tablespoons lukewarm milk. Dip 6 or 7 pieces of dough into the coating, then place them in the pan of chocolate. Shake the pan gently to coat the dough with chocolate. Place the pieces into a lightly greased 10\" tube pan or bundt-style pan; don\\'t crowd them. You\\'ll make two or more layers. Sprinkle any remaining chocolate atop the dough in the pan. Cover the pan, and let the bread rise for 1 to 2 hours, until it\\'s quite puffy, though not doubled in bulk. You\\'ll start to see white dough through the chocolate coating as they bread rises. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350F Bake the bread for about 30 to 35 minutes, till you can see it starting to brown underneath the chocolate. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf will register about 190F Remove the bread from the oven, and sprinkle it with the chocolate chips. Return to the oven for about 5 minutes, till the chips soften and look shiny. Take the bread out of the oven, and let it cool for about 10 minutes before removing from the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature, by pulling the bread apart piece by piece.\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

Whisk in the jam and lemon juice. cover and refrigerate 60-90 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Spoon the mixture into mounds (about 2 teaspoons each). Refrigerate 15 minutes or until firm. Use the cornstarch to dust your hands, and roll the mixture into balls. Refrigerate overnight. Remove centers from the refrigerator to warm to room temperature before the next steps. Melt 1 1/2 pounds of chopped chocolate and temper as follows. If the chocolate is dull, grainy, or blemished, heat to at least 115 degrees. When the chocolate is nearly melted, stir to complete the melt. Let the chocolate cool to 100 degrees. Look at the chunk of solid chocolate- it should be smooth, dark, and glossy, without dullness or streaking. Submerge the 6 ounces of solid chocolate in the melted chocolate and stir until the chocolate cools to 90 degrees. What this process does is isomerize the chocolate as it cools, so that the cooled shells will stay glossy and smooth, even in the refrigerator. If the solid chunk is dull, streaky, or grained, it will have the opposite effect. The taste will be the same, but tempering the chocolate makes the truffles much more attractive. When the chocolate has cooled to 90 degrees, remove the chunk and save it for the next time you temper chocolate. Smear a thin sample of the melted chocolate on wax paper and refrigerate for 2 minutes. The smear should cool glossy and smooth, and should break with a snap. Dip each truffle in chocolate; two forks seem to work the best for this (although I'd be interested in hearing anyone else's idea). Top the truffles with cocoa or nuts if desired; if you plan to do this, do each truffle as you dip them, because they solidify fairly quickly. Refrigerate until set.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

Place the applesauce, apricots, and sugar into a non-reactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Mix together, then add the raspberries. The raspberries will dominate the flavor. If you want apricot-flavored Pate de Fruit, omit the raspberries. Using a hand-held immersion blender or whisk, combine all of the ingredients until smooth and homogenous. As the mixture cooks, the natural pectin in the fruit will cause the mixture to thicken. Continue to cook until it is thick, mixing constantly. To test for the correct consistency, dip a whisk in the mixture and hold horizontally in front of you. Watch as the mixture drips off the whisk and back into the pan. If the mixture stays on the whisk and beads up into small balls, like pearls, it is ready. If it drips back into the pan in thin strands, it needs to be cooked a little longer. When the mixture is a bit thicker than jam, pour it into a spouted container. Fill either a half-dome or triangle shaped flexipan, depending on the desired design of the jewels and let rest for 4 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. If you do not have a flexipan, you can pour the Pate de Fruit into a 10-inch bottomless tart mold or cake ring placed on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Let the Pate de Fruit cool and set, about 3 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. To unmold, run a sharp paring knife between the fruit and the mold and lift off the mold. (At this point the Pate de Fruit can be stored, well wrapped in plastic and in an airtight container, for up to 2 months.) Sprinkle the top of the Pate de Fruit with a thin layer of sugar and flip it onto another sheet of parchment paper. Remove the parchment that is now on top. Sprinkle this side with more sugar. Using a wet chef's knife or cutter, cut the Pate de Fruit into any shapes. Roll each piece completely in sugar and serve.

You also dont really need to thaw them out before baking for more than a few minutes. Frost with icing. Now, the icing is actually the part that makes these so good! The rolls themselves are not sweet at all and really only transform into a dessert once the icing is added.

Its maybe roughly a cup of icing sugar, maybe 4 tablespoons of milk, and several dashes of cinnamon. You can experiment with the amounts until you get something youre happy with.

Put some flour on hands and spread rest on a wooden cutting board. Put dough on board and knead. I didn't know how to knead bread so I went to u-tube, the proper way is to use the heel of your hand to push the dough forward, then fold it over, rotate it a 1/4 turn and repeat. It also says to do this as quickly as possible, and DO NOT over knead it. 5 - 8 minutes is the most it ever takes. You will need to add flour, from the board, every so often because the dough is still a bit sticky, but again only as needed. You want to achive a moderately stiff dough, that is smooth and elastic. Put dough in a warm, greased bowl, cover with warm towel,and let rise 30 minutes. In the winter I put the whole bowl in my sink with some warm water because the air is chilly.

The cream will seperate some, and will sour. This is a good thing! Stir the cream to reincorporate the ingredients. Begin to slowly whip the cream, by hand or using a stand-mixer. When soft peaks begin to form whip faster. The butter fat will begin to seperate from the butter milk -- continue to whip until you have pea sized chunks of the butter fat clinging to the side of the bowl. This step may take some time, but be patient, it will happen! Line a collander or strainer with cheesecloth and place your butter fat / butter milk into the cheesecloth (make sure to catch the butter milk! you can use it for pancakes later! ). Pull the ends of the cheese cloth together and press down to get rid of more of the butter milk. You should now have a large hunk of very soft butter -- it\\'s still got some butter milk incorporated into it, so -- You now want to rinse the butter under cold running water to remove more of the butter milk -- I do it a small handfull at a time, and I do it over a strainer or collander so I don\\'t lose any small pieces. It takes some practice, but you\\'ll get the hang of it quickly. After you\\'ve rinsed all the butter, place it in a mixing bowl and begin to press it up against the side of the bowl using a flat spoon or rubber spatula. You\\'ll release more butter milk and water this way, so make sure to drain that off as you go. This is also the step where you will add any \\'special\\' ingredients i.e. salt, lavender, honey, whatever -- I prefer to make it un-salted, but recipezaar won\\'t let me post a recipe with only one ingredient, so I\\'m listing salt -- when you\\'re done with this step place the butter in some kind of mold (I use a cake pan lined with cheesecloth) and place it in the fridge. after a few hours the butter will have set and if you want to cut it into smaller pieces you can do so -- This is an incredibly simplified version of the recipe that I use to make the butter that we sell at the shop I work at -- I make approximately double this recipe every week. It\\'s easy and, actually, kind of fun. The end product will be much smoother and fresher than any butter you would buy at the store (unless, of course, you\\'re shopping where I work :) .) Starting with a better product will, of course, yield a better result. I suggest using raw, organic, unpasteurized cream, if you can get it. You will be pleasantly surprised with the result, and you will be doing your body, and the local economy, a favor. A note about culturing -- you can omit this step if you like, but I reccomend trying it at least once. I think if you do, you\\'ll never go back. It gives butter a characteristic flavor and a little more \\'zing.\\' I often have customers questioning this step saying things like \"So you just let the milk go BAD? Isn\\'t that un-healthy?\" I usually try to calm them by pointing out that this has been done for centuries with much success. A note about temperature -- you will find it very difficult to do this recipe in a hot kitchen. The butter will melt constantly and you\\'ll lose more in the rinsing process. At the same time, a cold kitchen will make it difficult as well. I find that 70 to 75 degrees is the ideal temperature.\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

Put the semolina in a large mixing bowl. Place 1/2 cup water in a sprayer and use it to moisten the semolina. Begin by spraying the surface, stirring the mixture with your hand, pressing down and moving the palm in a circular motion. It is better to have too little moisture than too much because you dont want to create a dough. Continue to spray and mix until water is evenly incorporated into the semolina; it should form tiny granules without clumping, and not all the water may be needed. At this point, depending on the texture of the mixture, you may want to sift it for uniformity and to remove any small clumps. To sift it, shake the moistened semolina through a strainer or colander with holes about 1/8 inch in diameter (better slightly larger than smaller) and into another bowl. After most of it has passed through, stir to continue to pass it through, then press to pass as much as possible. There may be a small amount of doughy mixture that wont go through the strainer as much as 1/3 cup and this may be discarded. Prepare a couscoussiere or steamer by adding four to five inches of water to the bottom, and bring it to a boil. Add the semolina and steam uncovered for 10 minutes, mixing about every 30 seconds to prevent clumping; after 10 minutes, the mixture wont clump any more. Cover, and continue to steam for another 30 minutes, stirring about every 10 minutes. Transfer the couscous to a bowl, sprinkle with salt, and drizzle with oil. Stir gently with a fork.

Danger! This is the dry-burn technique. I don't add water to the sugar before putting it on the heat, as some chefs do. Caramelizing sugar dry means it goes faster, but you have to watch it more closely and be ready with your cream. Here is an overview of what you are going to do:. Stand over the pan of sugar with a heatproof spatula ready, but do not touch the sugar until there is a full layer of melted and browning liquid sugar on the bottom with a smaller layer of unmelted white sugar on the top. When the edges of the melted sugar begin to darken, use the spatula to bring them into the center to help melt the unmelted sugar. Continue stirring and pushing the sugar around until it is all melted and evenly amber in color--like an old penny. When little bubbles begin to explode with dark smoke, give the sugar another moment and then remove from the heat. Immediately but slowly pour about 1/4 cup of the cream and corn syrup mixture into the burning-hot sugar. Be careful! It will pop and spit! Stir until it is incorporated, then add a bit more cream and stir, then continue until it is all inches. Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry. Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Mix the cream with the corn syrup in a measuring cup with a spout. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Heat the sugar in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat until it is melted and golden amber in color (see note above). Remove from the heat and, stirring constantly, slowly add a bit of the cream and corn syrup mixture to the caramel: It will fizzle, pop, and spurt. Stir until well combined, then add a little more and stir. Keep adding the cream a little at a time until all of it is incorporated. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the milk. Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry. Bring back to a boil over medium-high and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat. If any caramel flecks remain, pour the mixture through a sieve. Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth. Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath. Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes. Pour into frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy. Pack the ice cream into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

I used no liquids except for the stated 1 tsp Vanilla. My climate is desert arrid...so moisture in the air was not the issue. I thought my icing was terrible. I have listed this recipe off the box, almost verbatim. I take no credit for this recipe. My notes are mine, I stand firm on those.\\n\\n###\\n\\n',\n",

Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor. Turn the machine on and add 1 cup of warm water and the oil through the feed tube. Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, a little at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. If it is dry, add another tablespoon or two of water and process for another 10 seconds. (In the unlikely event that the mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.) Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round dough ball. Put the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let rise until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours. (You can cut this rising time short if you are in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 6 to 8 hours.) Proceed to step 4, or wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to a month. (Defrost in a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature.) When the dough is ready, form it into a ball and divide it into 2 or more pieces if you like; roll each piece into a round ball. Put each ball on a lightly floured surface, sprinkle with a little flour, and cover with plastic wrap or a towel. Let rest until they puff slightly, about 20 minutes. Proceed with any of the recipes that follow. Be sure to allow the dough to relax, stretching it a little bit at a time, when youre ready to roll it out; pressing the dough onto an oiled baking sheet is the easiest way to get this done. And bear in mind that its easier to handle small pies than large ones. You can bake the pies or grill them. An oven lined with a baking stone (or several uncoated quarry tiles) is ideal, but it requires a peel (a flat sheet of wood or metal with a long handle) to move the pizza about. A baking sheet, with or without a lip, is much easier, because you can press the dough right onto its surface. Since you use olive oil to prevent sticking, the process is a snap. Generally, toppings should never be too wet, or the dough will become soggy. In practice, this means fresh tomatoes should have some of their juice squeezed out and be thinly sliced, and preferably salted for a little while, before using; the same holds true for other moist vegetables like zucchini. It may be that there are more possible combinations of pizza toppings than moves in chess or atoms in the universe; in any case, there are a lot. Simple combinations are best, however; too many ingredients merely serve to muddy the flavors.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

Set aside In a larger bowl, cream the butter and sugar thoroughly untill fluffy. To this add the lime juice and vanilla and beat until combined. To the butter sugar mix, add the flour mix and gently combine with a spatula to bring together into a dough. You might need to add a Tablespoon or more of milk at this stage if needed, in order to make a soft dough. Divide the dough into 2 small balls. Take a piece of plastic cling film, put a dough ball on it and flatten with palm to make a disc. Wrap the disc with plastic cling film. Repeat the same with second dough ball. Chill both discs for about 30 minutes. Line your cookie sheet with parchment paper.Avoid using aluminium foil as the extreme heat will burn the cookies from the bottom. After chilling the dough, take one disc out, unwrap it and place it between two sheets of parchment paper. Initially, you may find it little difficult to roll because it is chilled. It will soften as you go along. Roll the disc using a floured rolling-pin into a sheet about 1/2 thick. Using a floured round cookie cutter cut the cookies from the rolled dough. Using a floured thin spatula, transfer the cookies to the lined cookie sheet. Preheat the oven to 350F. Chill the cut cookies again for 15 minutes. Once chilled, bake cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until the sides start turning brown. Cool completely on a cooling rack. Blueberry Paste: Tip the blueberries, water and sugar into a small sauce pan. Cook on low heat until the blueberries are soft and mushy. Transfer to a blender. Blend on high to form a puree. Dissolve cornstarch into the lime juice. Transfer the puree back into the sauce pan again and add cornstarch mix. Cook on very low heat for about 5-8 minutes until you get a thick paste. Cool completely before adding to the filling mixture. Blueberry Cream Filling: Make the filling by beating the cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer. Mix in powdered sugar until smooth. Add 2 Tablespoons of the cooled blueberry paste above to make a smooth mix. Assembly: Pipe or spread 1-2 tablespoons of blueberry filling onto the center of the bottom side of one cookie.

Temperature will drop to just above 200F. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches your desired temperature: 240 degrees F for very soft caramels, 245 for soft-but-chewy, 250 for hard. When the desired temperature is reached, pour the mixture immediately into the prepared loaf pan. Allow to cool until they are just slightly warm to the touch, then turn out onto parchment or waxed paper and cut to desired size. They're very rich, so I like small pieces. Wrap in squares of waxed paper to store. The softer ones will need to be refrigerated, the medium and hard ones will not. These also freeze well if you want to store them longer-term.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

In either the large bowl (if doing by hand) or in a mixer bowl, combine the oatmeal, yeast, molasses, and salt. Mix, adding 1 cup of flour at a time until JUST kneadable. This dough is sticky, do not add too much flour! Turn onto a floured surface (or add dough hook to machine) and knead about 8 minutes, using as little flour as you can and still knead it. Form dough into a ball, and place in an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a cloth and let rise 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and cut into half. Shape into loaves, or circles or any other shape you desire. Cover again and let rise for 40 minutes. Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes . VERY IMPORTANT: When baking in anytype of pan, grease them well. This bread will stick in a BIG way if the pans are ungreased.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\n",

Drizzle on the oil and incorporate it with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle in enough of the water (mixing it lightly with a fork) to moisten all the flour and make a dough that you can form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a circle about 1/2-inch thick On a lightly floured board or a sheet of waxed paper, roll the dough into a thin (about 1/8 inch) circle about 11 inches diameter. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the dough and trim the edges to leave a 1/2-inch overhang all around. Use the overhang to form a fluted edge. Place the crust in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Fill the shell and bake it according to the directions of your specific recipe. *To bake the crust without a filling; Preheat the oven to 425F. Line the prepared pie crust with aluminum foil and place it on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove it from the oven and discard the foil. Bake for 7 minutes.
